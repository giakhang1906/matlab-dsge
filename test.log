Normalizing the dynamic model...
Normalization failed with cutoff, trying symbolic normalization...
Could not normalize the dynamic model. Variable K_G is not in the maximum cardinality matching.
ERROR: If the model is declared linear the second derivatives must be equal to zero.
       The following equations have non-zero second derivatives:
